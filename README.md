     DB_PASS=<your_password>
     DJANGO_DEBUG='True'
     DB_NAME='receptor'
     HOSTS='<host_name or public_ip>,<another_host_name>'
     ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment

3. Install the project packages
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. Download Postgres database
